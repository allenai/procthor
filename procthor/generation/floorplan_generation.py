Things to consider:
- Hallways:
    - Our algorithm starts by placing doors between rooms
      for which connectivity was explicitly declared. Next,
      it connects any hallway to all of its adjacent public
      rooms. Unconnected private rooms are then connected,
      if possible, to an adjacent public room. Publics rooms
      with no connections are connected to an adjacent public
      room as well. Finally, our last step is a reachability test.
      We examine all rooms and if any is not reachable from
      the hallway, we use the adjacency relationships between
      rooms to find a path to the unreachable room, and create
      the necessary door(s).

    From the paper:
        However, placing initial positions adjacent to a
        wall does not always result in plausible results, as they
        tend to cause less regular room shapes. Therefore, we
        use a different approach. Based on the size ratio of the
        room and the total area of the building, we can estimate
        a desired area of the room. Cells positioned at least a
        specific distance (based on this estimated area) away
        from the walls are assigned a weight of 1. This results
        in much more plausible room shapes.

        This phase also deals with the defined adjacency con-
        straints. The adjacency constraints are always defined
        between two rooms, e.g. the bathroom should be next
        to the bedroom, the kitchen should be next to the living
        room, etc. When selecting the initial position of a room,
        we use the adjacency constraints to determine a list of
        rooms it should be adjacent to. We check whether these
        rooms already have an initial position. If there is, we
        alter the weights to high values in the surroundings of
        the initial positions of the rooms it should be adjacent to.
        This typically results in valid layouts; however there is a
        small chance that the algorithm grows another room in
        between the rooms that should be adjacent. To handle
        this case, we reset the generation process if some of the
        adjacency constraints were not met.

        Based on these grid weights, one cell is selected to place
        a room, and the weights around the selected cell are
        set to zero, to avoid several initial positions of different
        rooms to be too close to each other.

        The first phase of this algorithm is expanding rooms

        rectangular expansion phase for a building where rooms
        black, green and red have size ratios of, respectively, 8, 4

        characteristics of real life floor plans: (i) a higher priority
        is given to obtain rectangular areas and (ii) the growth is
        done using the maximum space available, in a linear way.
        For this, all empty line intervals in the grid m to which
        the selected room can expand to are considered. The
        maximum growth, i.e. the longest line interval, which

        there are no more directions available to grow or, in the
